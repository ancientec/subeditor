### onChange

example onChange function:   
```js
const onChange = (changed) => {
    console.log(changed.key, //the auto increment of change index
    changed.content, //the final content value after changed
    changed.change //the changed delta compare to previous version
    );
}
```

### instance

In application such as React, it might be handy for parent level to receive the current instance of editor.

```js

var _editor;


const instance = (editor) => {
    _editor = editor;
}

var subeditor = new SubEditor(elm, {instance : instance});

console.log(_editor === subeditor );
//true
```

### css

css style will be injected into document head upon initialization. your customized css should overwrite default style. For multiple instances within the same page, setting skipCss=true will prevent current instance from overwritting previous generated css style.

This is for creating new language or making changes to existing language. The current default English language can be accessed by calling SubEditor.langList.en. All current avaiable languages are en, zhCN, zhTW.

```js

    const langFr = {
        "bold" : "audacieux"
        //...more
    }
    //this will create a new language and set the current display language to fr
    new SubEditor(element, {langList : {fr : langFr}, lang : "fr"});
```

### lang

Default is en, if you want to alter the display language you should change this value, provided that you supply the new language.

### ln

A callback function to translate every language during runtime. This is useful for large project that has its own language settings.

```js
    const lnFunction = (str) => {
        switch(str) {
            case "bold":
                return "bboolldd";
            break;
            default:
                return str;
            break;
        }
    }
    new SubEditor(element, {ln : lnFunction});
```
   
### cfgList

Variables for plugins. Image and library comes with required variables for them to work. Please refer to the image plugin page for detail example.

```js
var imageCfg = {
        //the features to enable, can set to [] if only url is supported
        "image.features" : ["url","upload","library"],

        //the accepted file types (mime format)
        "image.accept.types" : "image/jpeg, image/jpg, image/png, image/apng, image/gif, image/webp",

        //number in mb, 0: no limit
        "image.upload.max.size" : 0,
        //number in mb, 0: no limit
        "image.upload.max.size.per.file" : 0,
        //0:accept multiple files, 1: accept 1 file
        "image.upload.accept.files" : 0,

        "image.url.rewrite.handler" : (u : string) => { return u.replace('http://','//').replace('https://','//')},
