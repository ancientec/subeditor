### onChange

example onChange function:   
```js
const onChange = (changed) => {
    console.log(changed.key, //the auto increment of change index
    changed.content, //the final content value after changed
    changed.change //the changed delta compare to previous version
    );
}
```

### instance

In application such as React, it might be handy for parent level to receive the current instance of editor.

```js

var _editor;


const instance = (editor) => {
    _editor = editor;
}

var subeditor = new SubEditor(elm, {instance : instance});

console.log(_editor === subeditor );
//true
```

### css

css style will be injected into document head upon initialization. your customized css should overwrite default style. For multiple instances within the same page, setting skipCss=true will prevent current instance from overwritting previous generated css style.

    const langFr = {
        "bold" : "audacieux"
        //...more
    }
    //this will create a new language and set the current display language to fr
    new SubEditor(element, {langList : {fr : langFr}, lang : "fr"});
```

### lang

Default is en, if you want to alter the display language you should change this value, provided that you supply the new language.

### ln

A callback function to translate every language during runtime. This is useful for large project that has its own language settings.

```js
    const lnFunction = (str) => {
        switch(str) {
            case "bold":
                return "bboolldd";
            break;
            default:
                return str;
            break;
        }
    }
    new SubEditor(element, {ln : lnFunction});
```
   
### cfgList

Variables for plugins. Image and library comes with required variables for them to work. Please refer to the image plugin page for detail example.

```js
var imageCfg = {
        //the features to enable, can set to [] if only url is supported
        "image.features" : ["url","upload","library"],

        //the accepted file types (mime format)
        "image.accept.types" : "image/jpeg, image/jpg, image/png, image/apng, image/gif, image/webp",

        "image.library.allow.search" : true,
        "image.upload.url" : "",
        //number in mb, 0: no limit
        "image.upload.max.size" : 0,
        //number in mb, 0: no limit
        "image.upload.max.size.per.file" : 0,
        //0:accept multiple files, 1: accept 1 file
        "image.upload.accept.files" : 0, 
        "image.upload.handler" : null,
        "image.url.rewrite.handler" : (u : string) => { return u.replace('http://','//').replace('https://','//')},
